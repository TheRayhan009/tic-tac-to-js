# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking their spots. The game displays the current player's turn, announces the winner or a draw, and includes a reset button to start a new game.

## Features

- Interactive 3x3 grid
- Turn indicator showing which player (X or O) is next
- Winner announcement or draw indication
- Game reset functionality

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the game structure and layout.
- `tikTakTo.css`: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `tikTakTo.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic and functionality.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheRayhan009/tik-tac-to-js

##Open index.html in your web browser

Open the index.html file with any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to start playing the game.

## How It Works

- **Gameplay:** Players take turns clicking on the grid cells to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
- **Win Check:** The game checks for win conditions after each move. If a player achieves a line of three marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they are declared the winner.
- **Draw Check:** If all cells are filled and no player has achieved a line of three, the game is declared a draw.
- **Reset:** The game can be reset using the "Reset Game" button, which reloads the page.
